18th Century Italians Proposed With Cream Buns—Do the Same With Our Maritozzi Recipe,PT375M,PT30M,PT420M,"['8', '10 buns']",N/A,"2 1/2 ounces glutinous rice flour (70 g; 6 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon), see notes3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons whole milk (200 ml; 209 g) whole milk1 1/2 ounces honey (45 g; 2 tablespoons)","For the Scald : Place sweet rice flour in a medium bowl. In a small saucepan, combine whole milk and honey, and bring to a boil over medium heat, 3 to 5 minutes. Pour boiling milk and honey over sweet rice flour and rapidly whisk until mixture thickens to a pudding-like consistency and registers between 155 to 170°F (68 to 77°C).
Cover bowl with a large plate or plastic wrap, and let sit until mixture has cooled to at least 80°F (27°C), about 1 hour.
For the Dough: Add milk, olive oil, and egg yolk to the scald mixture. Whisk until well combined.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment, combine flour, orange zest, salt, and yeast, and mix on low speed until well combined, about 15 seconds. Turn off mixer, then add scalded rice flour mixture all at once and mix on low speed until dough is uniform, about 2 minutes, using a flexible spatula to scrape down sides of bowl and dough hook as needed.
Increase speed to medium and mix until dough just starts to come away from sides of bowl, about 8 minutes. (The dough will remain sticky and webby. Do not overmix here— the dough should not be bouncy.)
Lightly grease a large bowl with olive oil; the bowl should be big enough for dough to double in size. Transfer dough to the greased bowl, and cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap. Let sit at warm room temperature (75 to 80°F; 24 to 27°C) until dough is puffy and expanded by about 1 1/2 times its original volume, 60 to 90 minutes.
Using lightly moistened hands, deflate dough until it is restored to its original volume. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until dough is no higher than 55°F (13°C), at least 2 hours and up to 24 hours.
Lightly flour top of dough and transfer to a lightly floured work surface. Using a knife or dough scraper, divide dough into 8 equal pieces, each about 70g (2 1/2 ounces) each. Gently shape each into a round. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let sit for 30 minutes. Line two 13- by 18-inch rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside.
Working with one ball of dough at a time (seam-side down) on a lightly floured work surface, shape each dough portion by cupping the dough in your hand and rolling it in a circular motion until a tight ball forms. Repeat with remaining dough portions and transfer buns to prepared baking sheet, spacing about 1 inch apart. Loosely cover with plastic wrap, and let buns rise until puffy and doubled in volume, about 3 hours.
When buns have proofed for about 2 hours 30 minutes, adjust oven racks to the second-from-top and second-from bottom positions. Preheat to 350°F (175°C). Brush buns with egg wash and bake until golden brown and puffed, about 20 minutes.
Remove from oven. Let cool on trays for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 15 minutes.
For the Filling: While the buns cool, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk mascarpone on medium speed until smooth, about 1 minute. Add heavy cream, powdered sugar, vanilla extract, and salt, and whip on medium speed until stiff peaks form, 3 to 4 minutes. (Alternatively, filling can be prepared in a large bowl using an electric hand mixer.)
When buns have cooled, use a serrated knife to cut a slit from top to bottom most of the way through each bun. Take care not to cut all the way through; the bottom should remain intact. Gently open 1 bun and, using a spoon or offset spatula, fill bun with cream mixture. Using an offset spatula, level cream with bun and smooth the edges, removing excess cream as needed. Garnish with desired toppings and dust with confectioners’ sugar. Repeat with remaining buns."

2 medium oranges, zested and juiced
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
For the Glaze:
4 ounces unsifted confectioners sugar (113 g; 1 cup)
1/2 teaspoon grated orange zest plus 3 to 4 teaspoons fresh juice, from above","For the Muffins: Adjust oven rack to middle position, and preheat to 350°F (175ºC). Line a 12-cup muffin pan with paper liners.
In a large bowl, whisk flour, brown sugar, cinnamon, baking soda, ginger, and salt to combine. Using a flexible spatula, fold in carrots, apple, coconut, golden raisins, and pecans until well combined.
In a medium bowl, whisk eggs, oil, 1 teaspoon orange zest, 1/4 cup orange juice, and vanilla to combine.
Fold egg mixture into carrot mixture until just combined. Divide batter evenly among prepared muffin cups (heaping 1/3 cup each). (It’s OK if the batter reaches the top of the paper liner.)
Bake until a cake tester or wooden pick inserted into the center comes out clean, 25 to 28 minutes. Let cool in pan for 10 minutes; transfer to a wire rack to cool completely, about 20 minutes.
For the Glaze : In a medium bowl, whisk powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon orange zest. Whisk in 3 to 4 teaspoons orange juice, 1/2 teaspoon at a time, until mixture is smooth and pourable.
Drizzle glaze over the cooled muffins. Garnish with additional orange zest if desired. Serve."
How to Make Truly Great Churros the Easy Way—No Special Tools Required,PT5M,PT45M,PT80M,"['6', '12 churros']",N/A,"3/4 cup (177 ml) water
6 tablespoons (84g) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes
2 teaspoons (8g) sugar
1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt use half as much by volume or the same weight
4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour (1 cup; 128g), sifted
1 large egg","In a 3-quart stainless-steel saucier or saucepan, combine water (or milk), butter, sugar, and salt.
Set over high and and cook until liquid comes to a rolling boil and butter has fully melted, about 4 minutes.
Remove from heat and add flour. Using a wooden spoon or stiff silicone spatula, thoroughly mix in flour until no lumps remain (make sure to hunt down and smash out any stubborn ones).
Return saucepan to medium-high heat and cook, stirring very frequently, until dough registers 175°F (80°C) on an instant-read thermometer; if you don&#39;t have a thermometer, other signs the dough is ready include a thin starchy film forming all over the inside of the saucier and the dough pulling together into a cohesive mass.
Let dough cool in saucepan, stirring frequently, until it registers 145°F on an instant-read thermometer. Add eggs 1 at a time, stirring well between additions until each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next, until a smooth, shiny paste forms.
Transfer choux dough to a pastry bag fitted with a roughly 1/2-inch (15mm) star piping tip. Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment and, using a ruler as a guide and a permanent marker for easily visible lines, draw 12 evenly spaced 7-inch lines. Flip paper over, then, holding the bag at a 45° angle, lightly drag the tip along the surface of the paper and apply steady downward pressure, while slowly piping a 1-inch wide line of choux following a single line on the template. To stop piping, cease applying pressure and move the pastry tip up and over toward the opposite end of the churro before completely lifting away. Continue to pipe until tray is full. Transfer to freezer and freeze until firm, at least 30 minutes. (If desired, you can skip this freezing step and instead pipe the pastry directly into the frying oil, snipping each length free with lightly oiled kitchen shears before piping the next, though this is a little trickier than freezing.)
Set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and line rack with paper towels. In a large Dutch oven or fryer, heat 2 inches of oil over medium-high heat to 350°F (175°C). Working in batches to avoid crowding the oil, fry frozen choux sticks until puffed and deep golden, about 2 minutes. Using a spider or strainer, carefully transfer churros to prepared wire rack and let drain. If using cinnamon sugar, toss churros in it while still warm to adhere, and/or serve with hot, thick chocolate (if desired) for dipping on the side."

Classic Yeasted Coffee Cake,PT45M,PT35M,PT430M,"['8', '1 9-inch coffee cake']",N/A,"For the Tangzhong:
80g whole milk (about 2 3/4 ounces; 1/3 cup)
16g bread flour (1/2 ounce; 2 tablespoons)
For the Dough:
60g whole milk (about 2 ounces; 1/4 cup), cold
256g bread flour (9 ounces; 2 cups)
56g unsalted butter (about 2 ounces; 4 tablespoons), softened
3 large egg yolks
30g granulated sugar (1 ounce; 2 tablespoons)

100g confectioners sugar (3 1/2 ounces; 1 cup)
1 tablespoon (15ml) whole milk, plus more as needed
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
Pinch kosher salt","For the Tangzhong: In a small saucepan, whisk milk and flour to combine. Cook over medium heat, whisking constantly, until mixture thickens to a stretchy pudding-like consistency, 2 to 3 minutes.
For the Dough: Using a flexible spatula, scrape hot tangzhong into the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook attachment; let cool until just warm to the touch, about 10 minutes. Add cold milk to tangzhong, followed by the flour, butter, egg yolks, sugar, yeast, and salt. Mix on low speed until dough is smooth, supple, and elastic, 12 to 15 minutes. (The dough should pass the “windowpane” test: Pull off a golf-ball-sized piece of dough and, using two hands, stretch it as thin as you can without the dough ripping. If you can see through it, the dough is ready to rest. If not, continue kneading for another 2 to 4 minutes or until the dough passes this test.)
Loosely cover bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let sit at warm room temperature (75 to 80ºF; 24 to 27ºC) until nearly doubled in size, 60 to 90 minutes.
Meanwhile, prepare the filling: In a small bowl, whisk brown sugar, flour, ground cinnamon, and salt to combine. Add pecans, followed by the melted butter, using your hands to toss and gently press until the mixture is sandy. Set aside.
Grease a 9-inch aluminum cake pan with nonstick spray. Line the pan with two 15-inch by 3-inch strips of parchment paper, overlapping them to form an “X” in the bottom of the pan. (There should be about 3 inches of overhang on the edges.)
When dough has risen, lightly flour top of dough and transfer to a lightly-floured work surface. Roll dough into a 9- by 16-inch rectangle. Scatter the filling evenly over the surface of the dough, and starting with the long end, roll the dough up as tightly as possible. Carefully pinch dough together along the seam to seal, and gently pat log to ensure even thickness; brush off any excess flour from the dough.
Gently coil dough around itself to create a circular shape. Cover with a clean, damp kitchen towel and let dough rest for 5 to 10 minutes to allow gluten to relax. Roll dough into a 9-inch wide circle about 3/4-inch thick, then transfer dough to prepared pan. Loosely cover with plastic wrap or damp kitchen towel and let rise at warm room temperature until dough appears slightly puffed, about 30 minutes. Tightly wrap cake pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 12.
When ready to bake, remove dough from refrigerator and let rise at warm room temperature until roughly doubled in size, dough is about 1 3/4-inches tall, and bounces back slowly when gently pressed, 1 to 2 hours.
To Bake: Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350ºF (175ºC).
Firmly press pecan halves into the surface of the dough, arranging them in a circular pattern around the dough. (Dough will deflate slightly—this is fine.)
Bake until light golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the cake registers 190°F (88ºC), 20 to 25 minutes. Remove cake from oven and, using a pastry brush, immediately brush cake with melted butter. Lift the parchment to remove the cake from the pan and transfer it to a wire cooling rack. Let cool until slightly warm, 30 to 40 minutes.
In a medium bowl, whisk confectioners sugar, milk, vanilla extract, and salt until smooth. Glaze should be thick but pourable; if glaze seems too thick, whisk in milk, 1 teaspoon at a time, until glaze is the right consistency.
Using a spoon, drizzle glaze evenly over cake. Let set for 10 minutes before slicing with a serrated knife and serving."

1 3/4 teaspoons (7g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
4 ounces unsalted butter (8 tablespoons; 115g)
4 ounces milk (8 tablespoons; 115g), any percentage will do
8 ounces plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt (about 1 cup; 225g), any percentage will do
4 ounces toasted pecan halves, roughly chopped (a shy cup; 115g), or more to taste
For the Caramel Topping:
12 ounces light brown candi sugar, such as Brewer&#39;s Best, or deeply toasted sugar (about 1 1/2 cups; 340g)
4 ounces heavy cream, plain or toasted (about 1/2 cup; 115g)
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight","For the Filling: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, combine butter, candi or toasted sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt. Mix on low speed until moistened, then increase to medium and beat the dark paste until creamy, light in color, and very soft, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a zip-top bag or disposable pastry bag and set aside until needed, up to 24 hours at room temperature.
For the Dough: Wipe the bowl with a paper towel, then whisk together flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and baking soda until thoroughly combined. Melt butter in a 2-quart saucier over low heat, then stir in milk and yogurt, warming to about 80°F (27°C). Add to flour and stir to form a very dry and shaggy dough. With the hook attachment, knead on low until silky-smooth and elastic, so that it can be gently stretched into a thin but rough sheet without tearing, about 20 minutes.
First Rise: Cover bowl with plastic and set dough to rise until puffy, light, and doubled in bulk, about 90 minutes at roughly 70°F (21°C). If the dough feels dense, firm, or overly resilient, rest 15 minutes before testing again (this is more likely in chilly months).
For the Caramel Topping: Just before shaping the dough, line a 9- by 13- by 2-inch aluminum baking pan with parchment (or use two parchment-lined 8-inch by 3-inch round cake pans). Add the candi or toasted sugar to the pan, along with the salt and plain or toasted cream (or divide these evenly between the two pans). Mash with a fork to roughly combine.
Shaping: Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface, dust with flour, and roll into a 13-inch square. Snip a corner from the bag of cinnamon filling, squeeze over the dough, and spread into an even layer with an offset spatula. Sprinkle pecans on top and roll to form a 12-inch log, ending seam side down.
Slide an 8-inch strand of thread, unflavored dental floss, or butcher&#39;s twine under the dough until you reach the middle. Cross the ends over the top and pull tight to divide the log in two. Cut each half into six 1-inch slices and arrange in the prepared pan(s).
Second Rise: Cover rolls with foil and refrigerate overnight, or up to 48 hours. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C); meanwhile, let the pan(s) stand at room temperature until oven is hot.
To Bake and Serve: Bake, covered, until the rolls are puffed and firm but pale, about 40 minutes. (If using dark pans, check on the cinnamon rolls after 25 minutes.) Remove the foil and continue baking until lightly browned, about 10 minutes more. Loosen rolls from the edge of a pan with a dull knife, then invert onto a serving plate (or plates). Serve immediately."

The World&#39;s Crispiest Egg May Be This Corn-Encrusted Colombian Snack,PT10M,PT25M,PT35M,"['8', '8 arepas']",N/A,"1 cup yellow or white masarepa (5 3/4 ounces; 163 g)
1 cup (236 g) water, plus more if needed
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (for table salt, use half as much by volume), plus more as needed
Vegetable or other neutral oil, for frying
8 large eggs","In a large mixing bowl, stir together masarepa, water, and salt. Using a clean hand, knead dough until evenly mixed and cohesive, about 1 minute. Let stand 5 minutes.
Using a sharp knife or scissors, cut the sides of a 1-quart or 1-gallon zipper-lock bag so that it is attached only at the bottom fold. In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat at least 2 inches of oil to 330°F (165°C) on an instant-read or fry thermometer. Meanwhile, divide dough into 8 even portions (about 1 3/4 ounces each); if dough is very brittle, mix in an additional 1 tablespoon water to moisten, then divide into balls and cover loosely with a kitchen towel,
Working with one ball of arepa dough at a time, roll between moistened hands to form a uniform ball. Set ball on the opened zipper-lock bag, then fold the bag closed over it. Using a tortilla press or a flat, heavy object like a cutting board or cast iron pan, evenly press down on the dough ball to flatten it into an even circle, roughly 3 inches in diameter and just under 1/4 inch thick. Smooth any jagged edges of the arepa (this can be done by smoothing the edges with a fingernail through the plastic, or with a wet finger directly on the arepa).
Crack 1 large egg into a small (preferably spouted) vessel or cup, being careful not to break the yolk. Season lightly with salt. Very carefully peel arepa from the plastic, taking care not to tear it, and gently lower it into the oil (this is the trickiest part, and it is easy to accidentally tear the uncooked arepa at this point; if you do, just roll it into a ball again, press it between the plastic back into a round, smooth the edges, and try again). Fry the arepa, gently spooning hot oil on top after it rises to the surface, until inflated, about 2 minutes. Carefully flip arepa and fry on second side 1 minute longer. Using a spider or slotted spoon, carefully transfer arepa to towels to drain.
When cool enough to handle, use a sharp knife to carefully cut slit into the arepa near the edge and large enough to slide the egg through. While holding the arepa in one hand and gently squeezing it to keep the slit open, very carefully slide the egg into the arepa.
Carefully lower the arepa back into the oil, using the spider or spoon to keep the slit-open side of the arepa slightly elevated until egg beings to set, then lower arepa fully into the oil. Fry until egg is cooked to your desired doneness, 1 to 2 minutes for a runnier yolk and 3 to 4 minutes for a more set one. Transfer to towels to drain once more. Repeat with remaining area dough and eggs. Serve warm."

Thick and Fluffy Pancakes From Homemade Pancake Mix Recipe,N/A,N/A,PT10M,8,N/A,"For the Pancake Mix:
4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal blue label (about 1 cup, spooned; 125g)
1/2 ounce sugar (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
1/2 ounce malted milk powder, such as Carnation or Hoosier Hill Farms (about 2 tablespoons; 15g)
1 1/2 teaspoons (6.8g) baking powder
1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 teaspoon (1.6g) baking soda
2 1/2 ounces refined coconut oil, solid and firm, between 68°F and 72°F (about 1/3 cup; 70g)
For the Pancakes:
4 ounces milk, any percentage will do , or non-dairy alternatives (about 1/2 cup; 115g)
1 large egg, straight from the fridge (1 3/4 ounces; 50g)
1/4 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 1/2 teaspoons ; 7g)
1 batch pancake mix, above (about 1 1/2 cups; 8 1/4 ounces; 233g)","For the Pancake Mix: In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, sugar, malted milk powder, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Process about 30 seconds to ensure the leavening agents are fully homogenized into flour.
Add solid coconut oil and pulse only until it disappears into a dry and powdery mix, just a few seconds. It&#39;s important that the coconut oil is fully combined into the flour, while also remaining powdery and dry, so use caution and avoid over-processing, especially with larger batches. At this point, you can either continue with the recipe or transfer the mix to an airtight container and store up to one year at or below 74°F (24°C), or until the date stamped on the package of coconut oil.
For the Pancakes: Preheat an electric griddle to 350°F (177°C), or heat a large, nonstick skillet to a similar temperature on the stovetop. In a large mixing bowl, whisk milk, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined. Add the prepared pancake mix, and whisk until relatively smooth, although a few flecks of coconut oil may dot the batter.
With a large scoop, measuring cup, or piping bag, divide batter in 1/3-cup portions (or as desired), and griddle until golden brown on either side, and cooked through the middle, about 90 seconds per side. Serve immediately, with butter, maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or whatever other toppings sound fun.
Troubleshooting: The timing and yield of this recipe will vary substantially depending on how the pancake batter is portioned as well as the exact temperature of the griddle itself. When pancakes are excessively browned but raw in the middle, the griddle is likely too hot; when the pancakes are cooked through but too soft and pale, the griddle may be too cool."

1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter","In a medium bowl, beat eggs with a disposable plastic or reusable wooden fork just until last traces of white are mixed in; season with salt and pepper.
In a perfectly unscratched 8-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter, swirling over moderate heat, until fully melted and foamy but not browned. Add eggs and stir rapidly with fork, tines up, while shaking pan to agitate eggs; make sure to move fork all around pan to break up curds and scrape them from bottom of skillet as they form. Stop stirring as soon as eggs are very softly scrambled and creamy (but still loose enough to come together into a single mass), 1 to 2 minutes.
Using fork, gently spread egg in an even layer around skillet and scrape down any wispy bits around the edges. The top surface should be loose and creamy, but if it looks too liquid and raw, cook undisturbed for another few seconds. (If it still flows, you can swirl skillet to send loose egg to the edges, where it will set more quickly.)
Remove from heat, tilt skillet up by its handle, and, using fork, gently roll omelette down over itself until it is nearly folded in half. Using fork, push omelette to edge of skillet so that lower edge of egg begins to just barely overhang; use fork to fold overhanging edge of egg up, closing omelette.
Hold skillet right over plate and turn omelette out onto it. It should be almond- or cigar-shaped, with the seam on bottom; if it&#39;s not, lay a clean kitchen towel over it and use your hands to adjust its shape and position, then remove towel. Serve.

1/4 teaspoon (1g) baking soda
4 ounces unsalted butter (8 tablespoons; 115g)
4 ounces milk (8 tablespoons; 115g), any percentage will do
8 ounces plain, unsweetened Greek yogurt (about 1 cup; 225g), any percentage will do","For the Frosting: Combine cream cheese and vanilla with half the powdered sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Mix on low to moisten, then sprinkle in the rest of the sugar a little at a time. Once it is incorporated, increase to medium and beat until creamy and pale ivory, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a zip-top bag or disposable pastry bag and set aside until needed, up to 24 hours at room temperature. (If your kitchen is chilly and the frosting hardens in that time, briefly microwave the bag to restore its creamy texture before use.)
For the Filling: Prepare filling with the same bowl and beater, mixing butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt on low speed until moistened. Increase to medium and beat the dark paste until creamy, light in color, and very soft, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a zip-top bag or disposable pastry bag and set aside until needed, up to 24 hours at room temperature. Reserve the pecans until it&#39;s time to fill and shape the rolls.
For the Dough: Wipe the bowl with a paper towel, then whisk together flour, sugar, yeast, salt, and baking soda until thoroughly combined. Melt butter in a 2-quart saucier over low heat, then stir in milk and yogurt, warming to about 80°F (27°C). Add to flour and stir to form a very dry and shaggy dough. With the hook attachment, knead on low until silky-smooth and elastic, able to be gently stretched into a thin but rough sheet without tearing, about 20 minutes.
First Rise: Cover bowl with plastic and set dough to rise until puffy, light, and doubled in bulk, about 90 minutes at roughly 70°F (21°C). If the dough feels dense, firm, or overly resilient, rest 15 minutes before testing again (this is more likely in chilly months).
Shaping: Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface, dust with flour, and roll into a 13-inch square. Snip a corner from the bag of cinnamon filling, squeeze over the dough, and spread into an even layer with an offset spatula. Sprinkle pecans on top and roll to form a 12-inch log, ending seam side down.
Slide an 8-inch strand of thread, unflavored dental floss, or butcher&#39;s twine under the dough until you reach the middle. Cross the ends over the top and pull tight to divide the log in two. Cut each half into six 1-inch slices and arrange in a parchment-lined 9- by 13- by 2-inch aluminum baking pan (or two 8-inch by 3-inch round cake pans).
Second Rise: Cover rolls with foil and refrigerate overnight, or up to 48 hours. Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C); meanwhile, let cinnamon rolls stand at room temperature until oven is hot.
To Bake and Serve: Bake, covered, until cinnamon rolls are puffed and firm but pale, about 45 minutes. (If using darker pans, check on the cinnamon rolls after 30 minutes.) Remove the foil and continue baking until lightly browned, about 15 minutes more. Snip a corner from the bag of frosting, squeeze over the cinnamon rolls, and spread into an even layer with the back of a spoon. Serve immediately, and leave no survivors; life’s too short for day-old cinnamon rolls."
Broccoli and Cheese Galette Recipe,PT10M,PT70M,PT210M,8,N/A,"1/2 batch Old-Fashioned Flaky Pie Dough
5 tablespoons (75ml) extra-virgin olive oil, divided
1 pound (450g) broccoli, cut into small florets with stalk slivers attached
1 medium (8-ounce, 225g) yellow onion, thinly sliced
Kosher salt
1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 1/2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 cup (235ml) whole milk
6 ounces (170g) grated Gruyère cheese, divided
1 large egg, beaten","Prepare old-fashioned flaky pie dough according to the recipe. After rolling, folding, and dividing dough in half, roll one portion into a 14-inch round. Transfer to a parchment-lined aluminum rimmed baking sheet, cover with plastic, and refrigerate to relax and chill dough for at least 2 hours or up to 24.
In a large sauté pan, heat 3 tablespoons (45ml) olive oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add broccoli and cook, stirring occasionally, until broccoli is crisp tender and lightly browned in spots, about 5 minutes.
Add onion along with the remaining 2 tablespoons (30ml) olive oil, season with salt, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Lower heat to to medium-low and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until broccoli and onions are tender, about 8 minutes longer. Add 3 tablespoons (45ml) water to pan and, using a spoon, scrape up any browned bits. Remove from heat.
Meanwhile, in a small saucepan, heat butter with flour over medium-high heat, until butter has melted and formed a paste with flour. Continue to cook, stirring, until raw flour scent is gone, about 1 minute. Whisk in milk until smooth and cook, whisking to prevent lumps, until sauce comes to a simmer and begins to thicken slightly. Lower heat to low and cook, stirring, until sauce is thick enough to coat back of a wooden spoon, about 3 minutes. Whisk in 4 ounces (115g) cheese until smooth, moving saucepan on and off heat to keep it hot enough to melt cheese but not so hot that it bubbles rapidly. Season Mornay sauce with salt.
Scrape the Mornay sauce into the broccoli and stir to combine.
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 400°F (205°C). Spread broccoli mixture on prepared dough round, leaving about a 2-inch border of dough all around. With a sharp knife, cut a series of slits in the border of dough, each running from filling to edge of dough, spacing them about 5 inches apart. Fold each segment of dough over filling, tugging gently so the edge of each segment tightly overlaps the one that came before. Chill galette for 10 minutes in the refrigerator.
Brush egg over chilled dough in a thin, even layer (including under each flap). This will give the crust a glossy, golden sheen and help bind the pieces together.
Bake galette for 20 minutes. Sprinkle remaining 2 ounces (55g) cheese all over the pastry, then continue cooking until galette is golden brown around the edges and bubbling in the center, about 20 minutes longer. Let cool 5 minutes, then slice into wedges and serve warm."

Unsalted butter, softened, for greasing baking dish
4 ounces (115g; about 1 cup) shredded Gruyère cheese","Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 275°F (135°C). Spread bread in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet, and bake until completely dried, about 35 minutes, rotating baking sheet and stirring bread cubes several times during baking. Remove from oven and allow to cool.
In a 12-inch cast iron skillet, cook bacon over medium heat, stirring frequently, until golden and crisp, about 10 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Drain and discard all but 1 tablespoon (15ml) bacon fat from the skillet. Add kale, season lightly with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, until kale is wilted but still vibrant in color, about 3 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, heavy cream, Dijon, thyme, 3/4 teaspoon salt, pepper, and nutmeg until well combined. Add the dried bread and fold gently to combine. Let soak until bread is softened and slightly puffed, folding occasionally with a flexible spatula, at least 15 and no more than 30 minutes.

Repeat with remaining bread, kale, bacon, and cheese. Pour any remaining custard over the layered strata. Using a flexible spatula, gently press down the top of the strata so that all the layers are submerged in the custard, but take care not to compress the bread. Cover tightly with aluminum foil. Allow strata to stand at room temperature for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, increase oven temperature to 325°F (160°C).
Bake strata until cheese is slightly melted, about 20 minutes. Remove foil, return baking dish to oven and continue to bake until strata is puffed and the center no longer jiggles when shaken, about 30 minutes. Remove from oven.
Adjust oven rack to 6 inches below broiler element and preheat broiler on high. Broil until surface of strata is lightly browned in spots, about 2 minutes. Transfer to heatproof surface and allow to cool for 10 minutes. Cut into portions and serve."
Basic Crepe Batter Recipe,PT5M,PT15M,PT20M,"['5', '10 crepes']",N/A,"2 large eggs
1 1/4 cups whole milk (10 fluid ounces; 280ml)

Pinch kosher salt
1 tablespoon (8g) sugar, if making sweet crepes
1 tablespoon minced fresh herbs, such as parsley, tarragon, chervil, or chives (optional; for savory crepes)","For the Batter: Combine eggs, milk, flour, melted butter or oil, salt, and sugar (if using) in a blender. Start blender on low speed and increase to high. Blend until smooth, about 10 seconds. Add herbs (if using) and pulse to combine. (Alternatively, you can combine the ingredients in a mixing bowl and whisk vigorously until smooth.)
To Cook: Heat a 10-inch nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron or carbon steel skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes. Lightly grease with oil or butter, using a paper towel to wipe out the excess.
Hold the pan&#39;s handle in one hand and pour in 3 to 4 tablespoons (45 to 60ml) batter, swirling and tilting pan immediately to spread batter in a thin, even layer over bottom of pan.

1 1/2 cups (375ml) whole milk
1 cinnamon stick or pinch ground cinnamon
1/2 vanilla bean (2g), split and scraped or 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
Two 3- by 1-inch strips orange zest from 1 large orange
1/8 teaspoon kosher salt
7 tablespoons (88g) plain or toasted sugar , divided
5 large egg yolks (75g)
2 tablespoons (28g) unsalted butter","If using fresh bread, adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 225°F (110°C). Set a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet. Using a bread knife, remove crusts from bread, then cut into four rectangular pieces that are 2 inches thick and about 1 1/2 inches wide and 4 inches long (the width and length of the pieces can be determined by the size of your loaf of bread; it&#39;s the thickness of the pieces that is most important). Arrange bread pieces on prepared baking sheet, leaving at least 1 inch of space between each piece, and bake, flipping pieces over halfway through, until lightly toasted and dry on their surface, 30 to 45 minutes. Transfer baking sheet to a heatproof surface to cool slightly, and increase oven temperature to 375°F (190°C). If using stale bread, you can skip the toasting step; cut the bread into pieces as described and preheat oven to 375°F.
Meanwhile, in a 2-quart saucier or saucepan, combine milk, cinnamon, vanilla, orange zest, and salt. Set over medium-low heat and cook, stirring frequently with a rubber spatula, until milk registers 190°F (88°C) on an instant-read thermometer, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat, cover, and set aside to steep for 30 minutes.
While the milk steeps, whisk together 1/4 cup (50g) sugar and egg yolks in a medium bowl until sugar is dissolved and mixture turns pale yellow, 2 to 3 minutes. Set a fine-mesh strainer over bowl with egg mixture, and slowly pour one-third of milk mixture into yolk mixture to temper, whisking constantly to prevent yolks from curdling. Add remaining milk mixture, whisking constantly until well-combined; set aside but don&#39;t clean strainer; wipe out saucepan.
Add bread to custard base and soak, turning pieces occasionally to ensure they are coated on all sides, until fully saturated and soft (they should barely hold together, so handle with care), 5 to 6 minutes. Using a small spatula, carefully transfer bread pieces to a plate, allowing excess liquid to drip back into the bowl of custard base; set bread pieces aside.
Strain custard base through fine-mesh strainer into now-empty saucier; you should have between 3/4 to 1 cup (175 to 240ml) of liquid. Return to stovetop; once again set aside but don&#39;t clean strainer, and wipe out bowl. Cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to prevent egg yolks from curdling, until mixture registers 175°F (79.5°C) on an instant-read thermometer and thickens slightly so that it coats the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes. Working quickly, remove from heat and pour crème anglaise through fine-mesh strainer back into now-empty bowl. Place piece of plastic wrap directly on surface of crème anglaise to prevent skin from forming, and refrigerate until ready to use.
In a medium cast iron skillet, melt butter over medium-high heat until just foaming. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons (25g) sugar in an even layer over butter, then add bread pieces to skillet. Cook, carefully turning pieces occasionally, until lightly browned on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer skillet to oven, and bake until bread pieces are heated through at the center, about 5 minutes.
Remove skillet from oven, and carefully flip bread pieces over so that bottom sides that were in contact with the pan are facing up. Sprinkle remaining 1 tablespoon (13g) sugar evenly over bread pieces. If using a blowtorch, ignite torch and caramelize sugar by sweeping flame 2 inches above bread pieces, until sugar is bubbling and deep golden brown. If not using a blowtorch, simply serve with the sprinkled sugar on top.
Divide crème anglaise between individual serving plates, followed by bread pieces. Serve immediately."

Thick and Fluffy Pancakes From Homemade Pancake Mix Recipe,N/A,N/A,PT10M,8,N/A,"For the Pancake Mix:
4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal blue label (about 1 cup, spooned; 125g)
1/2 ounce sugar (about 1 tablespoon; 15g)
1/2 ounce malted milk powder, such as Carnation or Hoosier Hill Farms (about 2 tablespoons; 15g)
1 1/2 teaspoons (6.8g) baking powder
1/2 teaspoon (2g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight
1/4 teaspoon (1.6g) baking soda
2 1/2 ounces refined coconut oil, solid and firm, between 68°F and 72°F (about 1/3 cup; 70g)
For the Pancakes:
4 ounces milk, any percentage will do , or non-dairy alternatives (about 1/2 cup; 115g)
1 large egg, straight from the fridge (1 3/4 ounces; 50g)
1/4 ounce vanilla extract (about 1 1/2 teaspoons ; 7g)
1 batch pancake mix, above (about 1 1/2 cups; 8 1/4 ounces; 233g)","For the Pancake Mix: In the bowl of a food processor, combine flour, sugar, malted milk powder, baking powder, salt, and baking soda. Process about 30 seconds to ensure the leavening agents are fully homogenized into flour.
Add solid coconut oil and pulse only until it disappears into a dry and powdery mix, just a few seconds. It&#39;s important that the coconut oil is fully combined into the flour, while also remaining powdery and dry, so use caution and avoid over-processing, especially with larger batches. At this point, you can either continue with the recipe or transfer the mix to an airtight container and store up to one year at or below 74°F (24°C), or until the date stamped on the package of coconut oil.
For the Pancakes: Preheat an electric griddle to 350°F (177°C), or heat a large, nonstick skillet to a similar temperature on the stovetop. In a large mixing bowl, whisk milk, egg, and vanilla extract until well combined. Add the prepared pancake mix, and whisk until relatively smooth, although a few flecks of coconut oil may dot the batter.
With a large scoop, measuring cup, or piping bag, divide batter in 1/3-cup portions (or as desired), and griddle until golden brown on either side, and cooked through the middle, about 90 seconds per side. Serve immediately, with butter, maple syrup, fresh fruit, whipped cream, or whatever other toppings sound fun.
Troubleshooting: The timing and yield of this recipe will vary substantially depending on how the pancake batter is portioned as well as the exact temperature of the griddle itself. When pancakes are excessively browned but raw in the middle, the griddle is likely too hot; when the pancakes are cooked through but too soft and pale, the griddle may be too cool."

1 tablespoon (9g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume
1 large egg (2 ounces; 55g)
18 tablespoons (255g) unsalted European-style butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes, divided
1 cup (240ml) cold whole milk
All-purpose flour, as needed
For the Cream Cheese Filling:
8 ounces (226g) cream cheese, softened
1 large egg yolk (18g)
1/4 cup powdered sugar, sifted, plus more for garnish (about 1 ounce; 30g)
1/2 teaspoon fresh lemon juice (from 1 lemon)
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher salt; for table salt, use half as much by volume
For the Egg Wash:
1 large egg, beaten","For the Danish Dough: In a medium bowl, whisk together warm water and the 1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar until the sugar dissolves. Whisk in yeast until well-combined; let stand, uncovered, at room temperature until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat together bread flour, salt, and remaining 6 tablespoons granulated sugar on low speed until combined, about 15 seconds. Add egg and 85g (6 tablespoons) butter; pulse mixer between low speed and off until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, about 3 minutes. Add remaining 170g (12 tablespoons) butter; pulse mixer between low speed and off until butter is coated with flour, about 10 seconds. Stir cold milk into yeast mixture, then slowly add yeast mixture while pulsing mixer between low speed and off, until a shaggy dough forms, about 2 minutes. (There will be pieces of dough that have formed together, but it will not be a smooth or homogeneous dough.)
Using a silicone spatula or a dough scraper, scrape dough onto a lightly floured work surface. Gently shape into a 7-inch square about 1 1/4-inch thick; the dough will be slightly sticky. Tightly wrap in plastic wrap; freeze until chilled, about 30 minutes.
On a lightly floured work surface, roll dough into a 18- by 9-inch rectangle (1/4-inch thick), with the long sides parallel to the counter edge. Fold the dough like a business letter: Fold dough into thirds (each section should be 6-inches wide) like a letter by bringing the right third over the center, then folding the left third over to create a smaller rectangle. (Use a bench scraper or the flat side of a chef’s knife to lift dough if necessary.) Transfer to a lightly floured 9- by 13-inch rimmed baking sheet. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate until firm, about 45 minutes. Repeat rolling, folding, and chilling process 2 more times for a total of 3 folds. After the final fold, refrigerate dough for 1 hour 30 minutes or overnight.
For the Cream Cheese Frosting: In a medium bowl, whisk together cream cheese, egg yolk, powdered sugar, lemon juice, vanilla, and salt until smooth. Using a silicone spatula, transfer the frosting to a pastry bag and secure the top with kitchen twine, a rubber band, or a chip clip; set aside at room temperature.
Line 2 rimmed baking sheets with parchment paper; set aside. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough into a roughly 13-inch square (1/4-inch thick). Using a sharp chef’s knife or pizza cutter, trim edges into a 12-inch square; cut into nine 4-inch squares. Working with 1 square at a time, brush each corner of the square with beaten egg. Fold each corner into the center of the square (all corners should touch in the center) and press down gently to seal. Repeat with the 8 remaining squares of dough. Transfer to prepared baking sheets, placing each square 2 to 3 inches apart.
To Bake the Pastries: Cut tip off the pastry bag to form a 1/2-inch hole. Gently press down in the center of the dough squares to create a small indentation; pipe the frosting in the center (about 2 tablespoons each; it’s okay if the mound of filling is taller than the dough.) Loosely cover with plastic wrap; let rise in a warm draft-free area (75°F or 24°C) until slightly puffed, about 45 minutes.
Preheat oven to 425°F (220ºC) with racks in upper third and lower third positions. Remove and discard plastic wrap. Gently brush tops and sides of dough with beaten egg. (For best results, try not to get egg wash on the cut edges of the dough.) Bake until puffed and lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Rotate baking sheets from top to bottom; reduce oven temperature to 375°F (with baking sheets in oven), and bake at 375°F until Danishes are puffed and deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes longer. (Keep a close eye during the last few minutes of baking; 1 tray may be ready before the other). Let cool slightly on baking sheets for 15 minutes. Garnish with additional powdered sugar; serve warm or at room temperature."
Youtiao (Chinese Fried Dough Sticks),PT25M,PT20M,PT895M,10 pieces,N/A,"Ingredients
1/2 cup (120ml) filtered water
1 large egg
2 1/4 cups, spooned (10 ounces/285g) all-purpose flour, such as Gold Medal Unbleached
1 tablespoon (12g) baking powder
1 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt
2 tablespoons (1 ounce/ 28g) cold, unsalted butter, cut into 4 pieces
8 cups vegetable oil, for frying","In a medium bowl, whisk water and egg until smooth and well combined; set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt until thoroughly combined, about 30 seconds. Add butter and egg mixture. Set bowl onto stand mixer and, using a dough hook, mix on low speed until liquids are absorbed and no dry flour remains, about 3 minutes.
Increase speed to medium-low and mix until butter is fully incorporated and dough starts to clear sides of bowl, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer dough to a bare work surface, knead for 30 seconds, and shape into a 9-inch log. Press log flat to 3/4-inch thickness. Wrap log in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours.
To shape the dough and prepare for frying: Remove dough from refrigerator and bring to room temperature, somewhere between 68° (20°C) and 72°F (22°C), around 2 to 3 hours. Unwrap dough and transfer to a well-floured work surface. Roll dough into a 10-inch by 6-inch rectangle. Using a pizza cutter or bench knife, divide dough into ten 1-inch by 6-inch strips. Cover dough loosely with a damp paper towel.
Working with one strip at a time, cut in half crosswise to form two 3-inch strips. Brush the unfloured top side of one 3-inch strip lightly with water, then layer the second 3-inch strip, unfloured side down, directly on top. Lay a chopstick lengthwise along the middle of the layered dough strip and press firmly to seal the strips together and form a groove. Repeat with remaining strips of dough and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let dough strips rest for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until it registers 400°F (204°C) on an instant-read thermometer; adjust heat as necessary to maintain this frying temperature. Set a wire rack on a rimmed baking sheet, and have a spider or chopsticks and salt (and/or other seasonings) nearby.
To fry the youtiao: Working with one dough strip at a time, hold both ends of dough and stretch to 8 to 10 inches in length. Carefully lower dough into heated oil, gently laying the strip away from you, then immediately stretch a second strip of dough and add it carefully to the oil. Cook until dough sticks begin to float, about 10 seconds. Using chopsticks or a slotted spoon, flip dough sticks and cook for 10 to 15 seconds longer, then continue flipping dough sticks in 10- to 15-second intervals until dough is puffed and golden brown, about 90 seconds total. Using a spider, transfer fried dough to the wire rack set in the rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with kosher salt. Return oil to 400°F and repeat with remaining dough. Serve immediately."
Jammy Fruit Bars Recipe,PT10M,PT45M,PT115M,9,N/A,"For the Dough:
4 1/2 ounces old fashioned rolled oats, not quick cooking, instant, or thick cut (about 1 1/3 cup; 128g)
4 1/2 ounces all-purpose flour (about 1 cup, spooned; 128g)
6 ounces light brown sugar (about 3/4 cup, firmly packed; 170g)
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon (4g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more for sprinkling; for table salt, use about half as much by volume or the same weight, plus additional salt for sprinkling
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
6 ounces cold, unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 3/4 cup; 170g)
1 large egg, straight from the fridge (about 1 3/4 ounces; 50g)
For the Filling:
8 ounces jam (volume will vary; 225g) or 12 ounces &#34;juicy&#34; fruit, such as whole blueberries or raspberries, pitted cherries, sliced strawberries, or peeled and diced peaches (volume will vary; 340g)
Lemon juice, to taste","Getting Ready: Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat to 350°F (180°C). Line an 8- by 2-inch square, anodized aluminum pan with two long strips of parchment to cover the bottom and sides, creasing as needed to ensure a secure fit.
Make the Dough: In a large bowl, combine rolled oats, all-purpose flour, brown sugar, baking powder, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon, then mix until homogenous. If needed, this dry mix can be bagged and stored at cool room temperature up until the date stamped on the carton of oatmeal. Add butter, toss to break up the pieces, and smash each cube flat. Continue smashing and rubbing until the butter has mostly disappeared into a clumpy, streusel-like mix. This can also be done on low speed in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, but take care not to overdo it. Add egg and stir with a flexible spatula until well incorporated to form a soft dough.
Making the Bars: Scatter 16 ounces (about two-thirds of the mixture; 455g) into the bottom of the prepared cake pan, and gently press into an even layer. The idea is to encourage the pieces into a single sheet, without compressing the dough with excessive force.
Spread the jam or scatter the fruit into an even layer over the dough. Sprinkle with salt and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice, to bring balance to the fruit or jam. The amount needed will vary for both, depending on the type of fruit and its sweetness/acidity, with sweeter, milder fruits or jams requiring a bit of a heavy hand, and mellow, acidic fruits needing less. That said, virtually all fruits and jams will benefit from at least a small sprinkling of salt and squeeze of lemon, so don&#39;t skip this step altogether.
Sprinkle the remaining dough on top of the jam or fruit layer, crumbling it like streusel. Bake until the &#34;cake&#34; is puffed, firm, and golden brown, about 45 minutes, although the exact timing will vary depending on the moisture content of the jam or fruit.
Cool directly in the pan until the bars are room temperature, then loosen the two exposed sides from the pan with a dull knife. Gently tug at the parchment to loosen the bars, then transfer to a cutting board, and cut into pieces as desired. Serve with a dollop of whipped cream, or plain as a bar cookie. Wrapped tightly in plastic, the bar cookies will keep 3 or 4 days at cool room temperature."

Daan Tat (Hong Kong-Style Egg Tart),PT420M,PT35M,PT455M,16 tarts,N/A,"For The Butter Block:
1 1/3 cups (6 1/4 ounces/180g), spooned, all-purpose flour, such as King Arthur
16 tablespoons (2 sticks/226g) unsalted European-style butter, chilled and cut into 8 pieces (see note)
For The Dough:
6 tablespoons (90ml) bottled or filtered water
1 large egg yolk (15g)
1 1/3 cups (6 1/4 ounces/180g), spooned, all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting
1 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; if using table salt, use half as much by volume or the same weight
For The Filling:
1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons (150ml) water
1/2 cup (3 1/2 ounces/100g) sugar
1/4 cup (60ml) evaporated milk
2 large eggs (110g)
2 large egg yolks (30g)
1 teaspoon (5ml) vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon (1g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt","For The Butter Block: In the bowl of a food processor, process flour and butter until a smooth paste forms and begins to gather around the blade, about 30 seconds. Scrape butter mixture onto large sheet of plastic wrap and cover with second sheet of plastic wrap. Gently press into rough 6-inch square and bring ends of plastic wrap over center to form a neat parcel. Using bench scraper, gently square the sides. Place in refrigerator and cool until slightly firmed, about 30 minutes.
For The Dough: In a small bowl, whisk water and egg yolk until smooth and combined, about 30 seconds; set aside. In now-empty bowl of food processor, pulse flour and salt until combined. With processor running, add egg yolk mixture and process until dough runs around processor blade, about 30 seconds. Transfer dough to lightly floured counter and knead until smooth, about 30 seconds. Press dough into rough 6-inch square, transfer to parchment paper-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap, and freeze until slightly firmed, about 25 minutes.
Remove butter block and dough from refrigerator/freezer and let rest on counter. Butter block will be ready when it reaches between 68° and 72°F (20-22°C), or when it gives way and is pliable when gently pressed, about 10 minutes. If too cool and firm, continue resting on counter until ready. The chilled dough block should have a similarly malleable texture as well.
On a generously floured work surface, roll the dough to a 13-inch by 6-inch rectangle. (Tip: to help straighten the sides, you can use a bench scraper as a straight edge to press and pull the dough into a neater rectangle.) Unwrap butter block and place in center of dough. Fold top and bottom flaps of dough over butter so they meet in center, pressing seam together with fingertips to seal. Using a rolling pin or your fingers, press or pinch the open sides of dough together to seal in the butter block.
Rotate dough 90 degrees so middle seam is perpendicular to the edge of the counter (dust the counter lightly with additional flour throughout this process as needed). Roll vertically to a roughly 16-inch by 6-inch rectangle. Fold top and bottom edge of dough to center, then fold in half again to form 4-inch by 6-inch rectangle. Rotate dough 90 degrees, then roll vertically once more to a 16-inch-long rectangle, and fold exactly as before. Place dough on the same parchment-lined baking sheet, wrap with plastic, and return to freezer for 30 minutes.
Transfer dough to a floured work surface so that the open edges are parallel to the counter edge and let rest until dough is pliable enough to gently bend when flexed, about 5 minutes. Using a rolling pin, gently beat and press the dough until it is pliable enough to roll without cracking. Roll vertically to a roughly 16-inch by 6-inch rectangle. Fold top and bottom edge of dough to center, then fold in half again to form a 4-inch by 6-inch rectangle. Place dough on the same parchment-lined baking sheet, wrap tightly with plastic, and refrigerate for 2 hours or freeze for up to 1 month.
To Shape and Bake: Transfer dough to floured work surface and divide in half, covering one piece loosely with plastic wrap. Let rest until the dough can be worked without cracking, about 10 minutes, although the timing will vary depending on the temperature of your kitchen and precise thickness of the dough. Working with one dough portion at a time, gently beat and press dough with rolling pin until dough is pliable. Roll to a 15-inch square measuring about 1/8-inch thick. Using a 3 3/4-inch ring cutter, cut 8 circles of dough; discard dough scraps or save for another use. Working with one circle at a time, press dough into a lightly greased tart mold, starting from center to edges, until dough clears sides of mold by about 1/8 inch. Using a fork, lightly poke holes in center of dough. Repeat with remaining dough. Transfer tart shells to freezer and chill until firm, about 30 minutes.
For The Filling: In a large bowl, whisk water and sugar until dissolved. Whisk in evaporated milk until combined and mixture cools slightly. Whisk in eggs, egg yolks, vanilla, and salt until smooth and combined; at this stage the mixture will be quite thin. Strain mixture through a very fine-mesh sieve into a 2-cup measuring cup, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for 1 hour or up to 24 hours.
Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 400°F (204°C). Arrange frozen tart shells on rimmed baking sheet and bring egg mixture to counter. Carefully pour egg mixture into tarts, stopping  1/4 inch from the rim. Bake tarts until pastry just begins to brown and custard is just set, pausing to rotate halfway through baking, 16 to 20 minutes. Let tarts cool in molds for 5 minutes. Unmold, cool an additional 10 minutes, and serve."

1 1/4 teaspoons Diamond Crystal kosher salt, plus more to taste as needed; for table salt, use half as much by volume
All-purpose flour, for dusting
2 sheets frozen puff pastry from one 14-ounce  box, thawed until pliable but cool
4 ounces (113g) full-fat cream cheese, softened
1 tablespoon (15g) Dijon mustard
1 1/2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme leaves, plus additional leaves for garnish
1 medium garlic clove (5g), minced (optional)
4 ounces shredded low-moisture mozzarella (113g; about 1 cup)
1 tablespoon (15ml) extra-virgin olive oil
Freshly ground black pepper
Finely grated zest of 1 lemon","Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with a double layer of paper towels or a clean kitchen towel. In a colander set over a large bowl, toss the zucchini with salt. Let drain for 30 minutes.
Press zucchini firmly with a rubber spatula to squeeze out moisture. Transfer zucchini to prepared baking sheet and spread evenly over towels; discard accumulated liquid and wipe out bowl. Use additional paper towels or a second clean kitchen towel to blot zucchini, ridding them of as much excess moisture as possible. Return zucchini to now empty bowl and set aside. Discard paper towels used to line rimmed baking sheet; line now empty baking sheet with parchment.
On a lightly floured surface, place one sheet of puff pastry directly on top of the other. Using a rolling pin, roll pastry into a 11- by 15-inch rectangle. Transfer pastry to prepared baking sheet. Poke pastry all over with a fork. Cover the pastry with a sheet of parchment and place another rimmed baking sheet on top. Bake until pastry is pale and firm to the touch, about 15 minutes. Remove from oven and remove the top baking sheet and parchment. Increase oven temperature to 445°F (230°C).
In a medium bowl, combine cream cheese, Dijon mustard, thyme, and garlic (if using) and stir together until well combined. Using an offset spatula, spread cream cheese mixture in an even layer over puff pastry, leaving a 1/2-inch border on all sides. Sprinkle evenly with mozzarella.
Add olive oil to bowl with reserved zucchini and toss to coat. Shingle zucchini in even rows over the mozzarella and season with freshly ground black pepper.
Bake tart until zucchini is tender and puff pastry is crisp and deeply browned at the edges, about 20 minutes.
Garnish tart with thyme leaves and lemon zest. Season with salt to taste. Cut into portions and serve immediately."
