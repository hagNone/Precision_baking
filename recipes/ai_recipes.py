A user is asking for the **{recipe.food_name}** recipe.
Here‚Äôs the structured data:

- **Prep Time:** {recipe.prep_time}
continue from the next line
- **Cook Time:** {recipe.cook_time}
continue from the next line
- **Total Time:** {recipe.total_time}
continue from the next line
- **Serves:** {recipe.serves}
continue from the next line
- **Freezing Time:** {recipe.freezing_time}
continue from the next line

**INGREDIENTS:**  
{recipe.ingredients if recipe.ingredients else "No ingredients found!"}
continue from the next line
**DIRECTIONS:**  
{recipe.directions if recipe.directions else "No directions found!"}
continue from the next line

Format the response in a clean, article-like structure:  
- Start with a fun introduction.
- Separate ingredients and directions into distinct sections with clear headings.  
- Use line breaks between each step and ingredient.  
- Keep it engaging with a casual tone, and sprinkle in some emojis where it fits.
